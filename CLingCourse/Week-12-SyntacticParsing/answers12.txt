1. Comparing Constituency Parsers

1) I shot an elephant in my pyjamas.
All of the parsers agree that "I" was in pajamas while shooting an elephant, which is more probable than an elephant in PJs.

2) Enraged cow injures farmer with ax.
Both Enju and OpenNLP parsed injures as NNS and said that cow was with an ax. Stanford parser wins this time.

3) I once saw a deer riding my bicycle.
Again, Enju and OpenNLP say that deer can ride a bicycle, which I doubt.

4) The killer was sentenced to die for the second time in 10 years.
All of the parsers seem to be mistaken here because of the PP that is not adjasent to the verb it belongs to.

5) Wanted : a nurse for a baby about twenty years old.
Stanford and OpenNLP say that baby is 20 yrs old. Enju, as far as I understood, says that baby is 20 yrs old and the nurse should be old.

6) I'm glad I'm a man, and so is Lola.
Only OpenNLP correctly determined that Lola is not a man here.

To sum up, Enju has shown the worst performance: 1 sentence out of 6 correctly parsed. OpenNLP - 2 out of 6, it seems to have problems with PP attachments. And the winner - Stanford - 3 out of 6.

2. Comparing Dependency Parsers

1) I shot an elephant in my pyjamas.
Both parsers did a good job here.

2) Enraged cow injures farmer with ax.
Stanford says that the cow injured the farmer using an ax and ARK made some strange modifier "Enraged cow injures" that modifies farmer, but farmer is with an ax though.

3) I once saw a deer riding my bicycle.
Stanford parsed the sentence correctly saying that "riding" is an open clausal complement for "saw". ARK says that deer was riding a bike.

4) The killer was sentenced to die for the second time in 10 years.
Unfortunately, both parsers agree that one can die twice.

5) Wanted : a nurse for a baby about twenty years old.
Again, both ARK and Stanford say that baby can be 20 years old.

6) I'm glad I'm a man, and so is Lola.
ARK did a good job here and parsed "glad" and "is" with conj connection. Stanford, however, says Lola is a man.

Summing up all correctly parsed sentences we have a draw! 2 for both Stanford and ARK. To my humble opinion, I would rather use Stanford, because it doesn't produce such strange parses as, for example, ARK in second sentence with "Enraged cow injures" and it also has universal dependency tags.
