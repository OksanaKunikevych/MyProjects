###Notes

1. Perfect!

2. Good job!

3. Good but incomplete. Try tokenizing the text, too.

   Update: You missed some commas before the quotation marks, for example, in:
   Reggie the old punk says, "Remember we used to talk about there being No Future ? Well. This is it ."
   But overall it's fine.

4. Correct!

5. Well done!

6. Well done! One small comment: to enclose a piece of text in quotation marks or brackets, you can simply select the text and type a quotation mark or a left bracket.
   
   P.S. "In the end" means "eventually". What you meant in the commands file is "at the end".

7. Very well!

8. Good, but usually you would pick something that is impossible to find in the text, like `#$#$#` or `**##**`.

9. Well done!

10. Good job!
