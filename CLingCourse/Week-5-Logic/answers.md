# 2. Formulas

**2.1**

(B ∧ ¬A) = "bottle" ∨ (C ∧ ¬B) = "bottleneck"

Or, more shortly: (B ∨ C) ∧ ¬A

**2.2**

(A ∧ B) = {"pepper", "toddler"}

(A ∧ B) ∧ ¬C) = {"pepper", "toddler", "bear"}

D ∨ ((B ∧ A) ∧ ¬(C ∧ B)) =  {"pepper", "toddler", "bear", "hereafter"}

**2.3**

(B ∧ ¬A) = "bottle"
(A ∧ (¬B ∧ ¬C)) = "and"
(C ∧ ¬A) = "bottleneck"

All together: (B ∧ ¬A) ∨ (A ∧ (¬B ∧ ¬C)) ∨ (C ∧ ¬A)

**2.4**

The only word we need is "pepper", so:

B ∧ D

# The 13th task

- divide all the coins on the table into two sets, 13 coins each
- flip one of the sets
- three results are possible: either we will end up with the same number of heads and tails in both sets, or each set will consist of 13 tails and 0 heads or vice versa.
