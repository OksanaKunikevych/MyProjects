1. String is not a number.
2. Very well
3. You, probably, didn't test your code. It doesn't compile. By the way, I don't think that `(genealogy "Helga" ...` could produce `Here is Pepe..`.
4. Good
5. You have some problems with some args combinations. Test your function more thoroughly. E.g., consider some variants with "not" as a contraction or full word in all combinations (first of all, in questions). Also, you have some problems with capitalization. E.g., when you have lowercase subject in an affirmative sentence.
6. Excellent
