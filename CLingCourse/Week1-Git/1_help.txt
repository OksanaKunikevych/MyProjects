 --porcelain
           Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This is
           similar to the short output, but will remain stable across Git
           versions and regardless of user configuration. See below for
           details.


   Porcelain Format
       The porcelain format is similar to the short format, but is guaranteed
       not to change in a backwards-incompatible way between Git versions or
       based on user configuration. This makes it ideal for parsing by
       scripts. The description of the short format above also describes the
       porcelain format, with a few exceptions:

        1. The user’s color.status configuration is not respected; color will
           always be off.

        2. The user’s status.relativePaths configuration is not respected;
           paths shown will always be relative to the repository root.
           
There is also an alternate -z format recommended for machine parsing.
       In that format, the status field is the same, but some other things
       change. First, the -> is omitted from rename entries and the field
       order is reversed (e.g from -> to becomes to from). Second, a NUL
       (ASCII 0) follows each filename, replacing space as a field separator
       and the terminating newline (but a space still separates the status
       field from the first filename). Third, filenames containing special
       characters are not specially formatted; no quoting or
       backslash-escaping is performed.
