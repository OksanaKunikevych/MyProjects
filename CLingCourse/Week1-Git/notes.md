## Notes

1. Good.
2. Nice.
3. Well done!
4. Good. "Will" and "shall" are usually considered to be modals, not auxiliaries, by the way.
5. Good.
6. What I can see from your log is that you have removed the file (`deleted file mode 100644`), not renamed it.  
    Update: It's clearer now. You should have still copied more from the log. The main thing is that renaming is shown as deleting the old file and creating a new one.
7. Well done!
8. This task is actually unfinished. You were suposed to created the `_unmerged` file, then resolve the conflict in the original file and commit both files. Thus, both files would be visible in the log.  
    Update: I still can't see both files in the log.  
    Update2: Perfect!
