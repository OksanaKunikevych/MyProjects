I would like to ask you about the weather in California in Julay{July}.
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity{city} and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot.
This is because the building is the rememberence{remembrance} of how well Chiang did in History.

Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisment{advertisement} regarding the musical show "Over the rainbow" I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above-mentioned show.
To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acted in the show, as you wrotte{wrote}.
Therefor{Therefore} you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy.
Appart{Apart} from that, the show was delayed forty-five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry.
Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accomodation{accommodation} in log cabins as I am not used to staying in the countryside and especially not in tents.
One day, Pat and I were going home, when she asked me if I would give a party befor{before} I go.

Invent glass was very eventuly{eventually} to architect.

And what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people, don't they all wear the same type of ugly but confortable{comfortable} shoes?

What a pitty{pity}!
However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate{moderate} what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
Let us try to appreciate thier{their} importance again.
I would be most greatful{grateful} if you could let me have some information:
Secondly, I would like to choose a tent for accommodation, because I have never spent time in a tent, that's why, I think it is a good oppotunity{opportunity} for me.
You should have written it in the advirtisement{advertisement}.
Firstly, I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw diffrent{different} actors.
This class techer{teaches} you how to organise what you want to write.
To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable, but don't worry, the shooping{shopping} centre is still there waiting for you!
Thirdly, in your advertisment{advertisement} it said that discounts would be available, but they were not.
In the show apears{appears} a different actor, so I was very disappointed.
I recommen{recommend} this buiding{building} to visit, because American students will know British students is how to study and different campus life.
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowdays{nowadays}, most of the comunity{community} of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.

Anyway, I took my headmistress with me and I had recommened{recommended} how wonderful this show was going to be.

Journalists follow  famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take fotos{photos} and get  information about them.
Moreover the discounts were not available as you said in the advertisment{advertisement} and I paid £20.
Despite being used in many ways, it could entartian{entertain} us as well.
If an activity has stayed with us,  mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it, that is the greatest of extasis{ecstasies}.
On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really nesseceraly{necessary}.
And he can ansewer{answer} me very quickly.
Besides that the most importand{important} thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got pshycological{psychological} problems and they are useful in sociaty{society}.

Without any doubt, it is a hystorical{historical} place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of  Greek history  during the passing of the centuries.
Secondly, regarding the accomodation{accommodation}, I would say I prefer living in a tent rather than in a log cabin because I used to sleep in a tent when I was staying in a local scout camp in my country.

In your advertisment{advertisement} you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented.
We must think more about the eviorment{environment} and live closer to nature.
The consert{concert} was briliant{brilliant}.

For this conference I suggest wearing somenthing{something} very confortable{comfortable} but elegant.
When I first entred{entered} the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here.
How has morden{modern} technology changed my life?
I'm sory{sorry} to say this, but the only time I will be able to take this trip is in July, according to our team's shudule{schedule}.

Although the world of computers will develop day by day, I lively hope we (human beings) can mantain{maintain} our way of seeing things.

I'm in London for the first time and I wondered what is interesting on your stage: I read in the newspaper the advertisment{advertisement} about the best musical show.
First of all, I was looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent{different} actor instead of him in spite of his name being written in the advertisement.
A lot of countries buy gans{guns}, for their safty{safety}  they say, but they buy them to kill people.
For example, 20 years ago, people who were affected by the AIDS Virus couldn't live more than two or three years, but now with the new science, there are several therapi{therapy} and now people affected by this virus can live many years.
When we finished at our primary school we went to the same secundary{secondary} school too, but we were in different classes.
Suddenly, an enourmous{enormous} saddness{sadness} caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definately{definitely} break up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore.
I think that is more convinient{convenient} than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty{forty} five minutes.
I have enterwed{interviewed} each student from my English class.
However, students who never have time for a healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins and fibre usually finish on "McDonalds" and hamburgers or Bic{Big} Macs.
I don't think that I'd enjoy it, all the people knicking{kicking} you, you can't walk properly or buy anything.
With this letter I would like to ask you if you wuld{would} change it because we saw in the London Advertiser an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It's too strickt{strict}.
Another thing that is said in the advertisment{advertisement} is that the evening show will start at 7:30 but  there was a forty-five minute delay.
We should use them in positif{positive} ways.
They invended{invented} so many things that have made  life more interesting and more ezier{easier}.
How is the wheather{weather} in California?
But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary{century} - the age of modern science.

The book is very easy to read, but if you don't have time I recomended{recommended} listening to the programme.
Maby{Maybe} she did it to make friends.
We do not speak here about luxuary{luxury} goods.
First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert{concert} would take place.
They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be  very good peaple{people}, because " Fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
And, finally, right before the start they announced that Danny Brook woud{would} not be in the show that evening.
So I feel ascere{scared} when I think about the consercuencias{consequences} if some of the viruses  or mad prapoel{people} misuse  as hapen{happen} thise{these} days with  sex or other .
Although this is a new experience, I would prefer climbing and Photographe{photography}.
They have more differet{different} functions and forms.
Secondly, it said the show started at 19:30, but it deleyed{delayed} until 20:15.
So we don't have to worry about how heavey{heavy} they will be.
At the concert they were very susscceful{successful} because they were very confident and I helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
Well, as you ask, I will tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins, I'm going to be able only to travel in that  month because of my job responsabilities{responsibilities}.
I also think I am lucky, because I live in a period of tecnologic{technological} boom.
Secondly for us there are  disadvantatge{disadvantages} because  pollution affects us indirectly, and because I don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
The opening of the school, recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in, could be a good begining{beginning}.
I think modern technology has changed mankind's life a lot, expecially{especially} since last century.
The show should have started t{at} 19.30.

The nember{number} 101 bus leaves from the airport, then you can get off at the "city college" stop.
I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a plesent{pleasant} evening.
In the advertisment{advertisement} it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason.
So, as a conlusion{conclusion}, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead.
Nowaday{Nowadays} people wear fewer clothes.
THIRDLY, I WAS VERY EMBARASED{EMBARRASSED} TO DISCOVER THERE WERE NO DISCOUNTS AT THE ENTRANCE.

About accomodation{accommodation} at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer to nature.
The show is going to take place in the Gernal{General} Exhibition Hall in London, the thurday{thursday} 14 of March, so it could be a good idea to see this show intead{instead} of going to the Science Museum.
Therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fashinating{fascinating}.
As far as accomodation{accommodation} is concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable, and, therefore, I have never stayed in a tent.
And also, I would prefer the log cabins to the tents, as I have never slept in a sleepin{sleeping} bag before.

I'M WRITING TO YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW" WICH{WHICH} WAS PERFORMED LAST WEEK.

Although it was written in the show's addvertisement{advertisement} that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.
Also there is a big problem: the mony{money}.

I'm not really a young man and during the recent years of my life I becamehave become accostomed{accustomed} to  comfort.
Your advertisment{advertisement} was unfair.
Shopping sounds very enjobleable{enjoyable} and is fantastic for women.
I would offer you one suggestion that concers{concerns} the classical concerts.

You should return my money immedeastry{immediately} because that night was far from parfect{perfect}.
Nowaday{Nowadays}, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that allows me to connect to the Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get information and electronic mail.
THE KIND OF ACCOMODATION{ACCOMMODATION} I PREFER IS  A TENT BECAUSE AT  SOMMER{SUMMER} CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING OUTSIDE UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM.
When we think about clothes in the future, we should think about the enviroment{environment} first.
The majorite{majority} have chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, either at the Roman life style, or in the midle{middle} ages, when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands.
THAT SAID, TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINOUSLY{CONTINUOUSLY} SINCE THE BEGGINING{BEGINNING} OF MAN'S EVOLUTION.
On the other hand, due to scientific developments, I am getting better, recovering from ahsma{asthma}.
During the camp I would like to pratise{practise} my swimming (I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years) and also I would like to learn how to take some good photos.
I was pleased to recieve{receive} your letter ricently{recently}.
Definately{Definitely}, they don't give real solutions and advice.
To answer your second question, I choose the accomodation{accommodation} in a tent because I like to sleep outside.
I know how to climb up on Rachiat outside and help other people to climp{climb} up.
Yoors{Yours} sincerely
Everybody was schocked{shocked} and I was trying to keep the faith.
In addition, I will be busy with my cousework{course work} in August.
I was shoked{shocked} because I had alredy{already} spoken with them and I had got two autographs.
You will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettible{unforgettable} one when you read through my letter.
Regarding  what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you take the students to our History Museim{Museum}.
I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is  bad beheviour{behaviour}.
All these items of equippments{equipment} are  applications of modern science.
I don't know what tipe{type} of clothes  I have to take or the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information I would be very pleased.
Thechnology{Technology} helps people.
At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I have spent the whole morning doing nothing, except for looking at them trying on diferent{different} clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's really annoying.
First of all, I was surpprising{surprising} that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not perform.
Really I was very nervous but at the same time very happy, but everything went well and everyboby{everybody} was very hapy{happy} with my work.
I climed{climbed} up the tree.
On balance fashion in 100 years time will be confortable{comfortable} and colourful.
The other activitie{activity} is Photography.
Also, the times printed in your advertisment{advertisement} were 14.30 and 19:30.
HOW CAN THIS CLASS OF THEATRE BE SO .. OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ONE LAST THING, IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER HAD SO I DEMEND{DEMAND}  MY MONEY BACK!
Well shopping can became horrible at christmast{Christmas} for example, when houndred{hundred} of people go to the shopping centre and it also can cause many problems when you become an impulsive buyer.
However, secondly, famous people are not "ailen{alien}" so  they might do something, for example, ashame{shameful} things in a public space, or argue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us.
I like very much the moutains{mountains} and would particularly enjoy painting them after a walk.
In addition to this you will be able to control all parts of the house by  computer such as temperature or vacume{vacuum} cleaning.
I nearly shouted with happines{happiness} when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert.
Last month I was in London for a week to visit your wonderful city and with the intention of seeing at your Thetre{theatre} the famous musical show Over the rainbow but in all my life I have never had such a disappointing evening.
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not performing and I was more bewildered that no one made an apologie{apology} for it!
Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody{nobody} wanted to ask Sarah because it was told as a secret to them.
Yours Sinicerely{Sincerely},
This is the most argueing{arguing} point.
But in the breaks and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engieners{engineers}, and I learnt something about setting up the equitment{equipment}.
We've built it using ready metal and wodden{wooden} parts.
Pusan Castle is locted{located} in the South of Pusan.
I met a lot of interresting{interesting} people while I was serving drinks.
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps{autographs} from.
I am taking photograghy{photography} lessons at univercity{university} and I started tennis when I was 10 so I am good at bouth{both} of them.
About the gymnastick{gymnastic} centres, I like them very much.
At first it was a great plessure{pleasure} for me to get a ticket therefor{therefore} becauses{because} I'm one of  Danny Brook's greatest fans.
"Wuthering Heights" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very accurate afimation{affirmation} in the case of my book because the main character in the story is a very wicked man.
Nowdays{Nowadays},  technology  keeps developing and  better technology gives us an easier life.
There are a number of hotels or youth hostels  to stay overninight{overnight}, if necessary.
In the present day, for ecsample{example}, a lot of people have a personal computer at home, and a very large proportion of those also have the Internet, the new frontier of computer evolution.
The place I would like to recommend is the seventienth-century{seventeenth-century} Royal Palace.
I'm writeng{writing} with reference to your letter.
To begin with the wchool{school} rules, we have in fact some important ones.
Mike had many affairs while he was married to Leto who wasonce{was once} called Stacy.
A lot of money is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of polution{pollution}.
In the advertisment{advertisement} it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play the main roles.
Communication techology{technology}, e.g. internet (networks) and moible{mobile} phones.
As we have seen the advertisment{advertisement} for the programme the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class, which we have hardly done at all.
As you need more information, I will answer all your questions with plesuare{pleasure}.
Firstly, the great boom in mass comunication{communication} wich{which} happened at the beginning of our decade, with the devellopment{development} of telephones, radio stations, television and even satelites{satellites}, and of course, the Internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
But we should not forget that they are only tools and should emphazise{emphasise} human relationships.
Secondly discounts were not availabe{available}.
A lot of bosses or workers in  factories  do not need to employ many claver{clever} workers because we don't need a lot of them.
Only those who get good marks can take part in theese{these} activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
Summing up, you might have realised that that wasn't "my perfect evening out" wich{which} you promised, so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back.
Towards the end of the concert I hansled{handed} a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte.
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the mounth{month} he can give me one, so I hope that isn't a problem for you.
If you need futher{further} information do not hesitate to contact us.
In the advertisment{advertisement} it said - "discounts available".
Rescently{Recently} I decided to see Over The Rainbow, a very famous and well-known show.
Finally, on the last day I sugget{suggest} you go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around.
One day, I fell in love with my closest freind{friend}.
When I ride it is only me and my motocycle{motorcycle}.
Ballons{Balloons} and coloured lights were put in all the trees.
Can you imagen{imagine} being in Japan or China and having to go to the shops?
I told Pat everything even my secrects{secrets} when we were still friendly.
First of all, on the sheet I recived{received}, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actors.
I and some athers{other} friends  disided{decided} to go to the theatre to see a musical show.
When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering, it became the best oportunity{opportunity} I ever had to asist{assist}  a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writing to you.
In the advirtisement{advertisement} it said that Danny Brook was in the starring role.
Because this is my Hoilday{Holiday} start at the Camp California, I would like my accommodation in a tent, because I work in the Army and on the camp I usually stay in a tent at night, so I will feel more comfortable.
Will I be given any pocket-money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expences{expenses}?
Maybe there will be a remedium{remedy} for AIDs or cancer soon.
For de{the} accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because it'll be more comfortable.
I was given the list of activities while I was taking part in the adventure school schems{schemes} at the soldier camps in the north of Thailand.
And the restorant{restaurant} of the theatre was being pait{paint}, so I could not go there as you said in the advertisment{advertisement}.
At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand{recommend} it to other friends.
It is a maching{machine} that makes  life easy and ibendow you can cari{carry} it everywhere.
Also, teachers began to ask us for a lot of articles which were to be copied throught{through} the Internet.
I would like to ask whather{whether} you have competitions or different activities.
They nead{need} to be with their family in peace.
I belong to the generation who have grown up with a lot of new technolgy{technology}.
I quickly became bored by this hypocrital{hypocritical} attention they gave me.
There are more and more retailors{retailers}  opening .
It informs people, hospitals use modern technogoly{technology}, and the computer helps staders and helps people do their job.
Introduction: The aim of this report is to summerize{summarize} the right lessons and activities to be filmed.
Definetely{Definitely}, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back.
The next morning we had an arguiment{argument} with Pat.
Everthing{Everything} is easy now.
My family allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alchol{alcohol} of course, which I don't do anyway.
Moroever{Moreover}, I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine.
I would like to travel only in July, because I am going to study at my university untill{until} the end of June.
In the last fourty{forty} years people seem to have become completely addicted to using their  car.
Therefore, I hope that you can agree to a suitable arguement{argument} between you and me.
The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we fained{find} it very interesting, because we will have the opportunity to see mews, firstly about the latest fashions, secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make-up and hairstyles.
Althoug{Although}  modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it give you nature, peace and fresh air?
I have a lot of posibilities{possibilities} for spending my spare time.
It also mentioned other services would be availalde{available} to the adicne{audience}.
The task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algoritms{algorithms} and databases but anyway we decided to do it.
Firstly, about your accomodation{accommodation}, the college which I belong to offers visitors free accomodations{accommodations} with full of facilities (for example, bath, car park, free internet access, etc.).
I don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so I am rather puzzeled{puzzled} about what to wear there.
Often you wear very litte{little} but short skirts and tops.
Children are not studying as much as they ought to, because they are watching TV, speacing{speaking} on the phone or even playing computer games.
Also, I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was a success and every day it was croweded{crowded} because I believed that this was a result which came about with my help.
To sum up, I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers, which has affected both indivisuals{individuals} and  society as a whole.
There, I saw the exibitions{exhibitions} and admired the building itself.
So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasent{unpleasant} night.
I have recieved{received} your letter this morning.
On behalf of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a galery{gallery}.
I have just finished a profesional{professional} photography course and I would like to continiew{continue} my education in this activity.
I would like to travel in July because I am a studant{student} so I only have holidays in this part of the year.
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afteroon{afternoon}.
The Old Town is the best place for an afternoon stroll, with a great deal of restaurants, caffes{cafes} and street performers.
If that does not seem enough, after the show my boyfriend wanted to take me to eat something in the theatre's restaurant but the umpleasent{unpleasant} surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday.
In my opinion, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most  machines, appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can only be operated with electricity, which makes people not do too much phisical{physical} labour.
I am writing to inform you that I have recieved{received} a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college.
But now we can eaven{even} see the face of the person we are chatting to.
In fact, I visited some Englishe{English} classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers.
As a youngman{young man} he was a famous charioteer.
I personally think the best  would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them, point and ask for authopraps{autographs}, like in the zoo.
THE CONCERT WAS VERRY{VERY} LOUD AND LONG BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK HARD.
But people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliaces{appliances} in their houses yet.
So, my templary{temporary} job was sound engineer but I was not main engineer.
Maybe, it is a good way to get an audience but I'm going to comunicate{communicate}  my travel agent.
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie{gypsy}.
thank you for your letter, wich{which} arrived yesterday.
You have to know that I am very sik{sick} because of my blood presure{pressure} and so I was laying down the whole weekend.
One should have such marks as ,,3", ,,4", ,,5", not ,,2", which is eaqual{equal} to fail.
We  really appriciate{appreciate} your  organising a very nice programme, which has been organised by you this time.
There was no Danny Brook but instead of him there was a different actor and I'm very dissapointed{disappointed} about that because I'm a fan of his.
Dear Mz.{Mrs}
Because of all this troubel{trouble} I think we should have our money back.
Moreover, once I was  paying for the tickets, I found another thing out: there were no discounts avaible{available}.
Secondly, you have a lot of choises{choices} and you do not know what to buy.
Last night, when I went into my house it was quite scilence{silence}.
She was one of my friends and I couldn't trust her at all because she was a truble{trouble} maker.
Furthermore,  addmission{admission} is free for students.
Thank you for this prize, I'm really ecited{excited} and emotional.
Of course, she would tell him, but I decided to pay her if she beheaved{behaved} quiet.
I would prefer to stay in a tent, couse{because} in that way I can feel more clouse{close} to  nature, and I can remember when I was a girl scout.
yours sinicrely{sincerely}
I would like to apologise to you for my controversary{controversial} opinnion{opinion} but I feel really disappointed.
I look forward to recieving{receiving} some information from you.
I closed my eyes, tooke{took} a deep breath and jumed{jumped} out of the tower.
To make a daily life video in school, we should concentrat{concentrate} on the things we do most in a school.
I told  her about my pregnency{pregnancy} because she has a friend who works in a hospital as a doctor.
When it was time to take the final exam, she became ill and she couldn't do it so the teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks, but on the other hand the principal desagreeded{disagreed}  and didn't give  permision{permission} to pass her.
The computer  is our way of with the outside world comunicat{communicate}, wheres{whereas} with aeroplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much faster than we would if we used boats or trains.
This is a good oppertunate{opportunity} to see how they learn in class.
The most important thing will be your fugure{figure}, such as long legs or pear-sharped{pear-shaped}.
About the Accomodation{accommodation} I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I have never been in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins.
I had waited for fourthey{forty} five minutes.
Although I like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, I'd prefer a confortable{comfortable} and private place (if it's possible) where I can sleep, or be quiet..
They are much more confortable{comfortable} than tents.
I believe that I am like that  , I belong to that centure{century}.
Due to my back enjure{injury}, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit.
In conculsion{conclusion}, I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two ways.
Desingres{Designers} are unique in a way but their desings{designs} are sometimes more a pirce{piece} of art and not for everyday perposoe{purpose}.
When I recived{received} your letter, I could not belive{believe} it.
This is a great oppotunity{opportunity} for me to explore and experience London myself, especially The London fashion and leisure shows.
As different kinds of farbics{fabrics} will be invented and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen.
Yeah fokes{folks}, that was the point I got interupted{interrupted} by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the "Rossall-School-magazin{magazine}", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
So one day she invited  me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illigal{illegal}.
I had a nice expirience{experience} as manager too.
When I was 16 years old I fell in love with the most hundsom{handsome} boy in our school.
We have all been shooping{shopping} once in our lives and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why?
It would be good to show the swimming poole{pool}, the gim{gym}, etc.
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave  the people the opportunity to attemp{attend} for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
I vish{wish} you had been here with me.
For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a hourse{horse} but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
Famous people diserve{deserve} also to have a private life.
The rules in my country are standart{standard}, I mean, the rules are very similar to other countries in Europe.
We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts weren't available for us, because they didn't accept our student indentity{identity} cards from Switzerland.
The who groups had comdined{combined} their forces and were ready to strike.
Anyway, this is not always necessarily a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, becouse{because} it gets people talking about him and increases his popularity.
I really apreciate{appreciate} this kind of trip and I'm really grateful for your  attention.
Computers are little things  nowadays, but at the speed at which tecnology{technology} develops, in the next century  clothes will tell our doctors about our healt{health} at any moment, any time, anywhere, people will be able to locate us arround{around} the world.
Staying in a tent will remind me of an unforgottable{unforgettable} time.
It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenent{convenient} for the airport.
I'm writing to you because we saw a great advetisement{advertisement} for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show.
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music, as I brought some cassets{cassettes} with me from Thailand.
I think that if famous people are always followed by journalists it is not the responsability{responsibility} of the media but of the huge number of people who are interested in famous people's lives.
Althoung{Although} swimming is so boring, it would be a good thing to help  cure my back.
I am a complete Beginer{Beginner} but I am dying to do it.
sincinerly{sincerely}  Ki
Dear Sir/ Madame{Madam},
We all work separately, developing  individually and forgoten{forgotten} we have to all talk together to know about each other's life.
Nowadays we have capitalism, free market, lots of privete{private} shops, markets and supermarkets.
I look forword{forward} to going to the Camp California in the USA.
Finally could you please tell me wich{which} kind of clothes should I take with me and if the camping equipment is provided?
The fashion industry will deliver a wide  of vararity{variety}  styles, materials and colours.
Finally, I would like to ask for my money back on the ticket due to the disapointing{disappointing} evening out and the misleading advertisement you have created.
So this is a great oppotunity{opportunity} for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstation{demonstration} from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
However, I can go out wheneve{whenever} I want, even at  midnight.
Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to get further information about something that intersts{interests} you.
To be honest that was not a great expierence{experience} and I hope you will see my point.
I will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the maschines{machines} wich{which} do the washing and the washing-up, before this,  women spent a long time doing these tasks.
Not only that: we had the bad surprise that Brook had been substituded{substituted} by another actor!
Its paviment{pavement} is made from many small pecis{pieces} of wood.
Not only because she's famous and wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce caracthers{characters} and how to tell a good story us though decieving{deceiving} the readers.
During the afternoon, Tim and I spent the hours before the concer{concert} lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held.
His mind made up and ready to go to the police he left our house, where me and my friends were just hanging aroud{around}.
In fact there would be only one possibility in July because I will finish  my exams  at the end of that month and beginn{begin}  vocational training the 1st of August.
Furthur{Further} more, the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay.
In the advertisement, it  said that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really dissapointing{disappointing}.
Singing is the most favarite{favourite} hobby for us.
I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOPE{DEVELOP} ALONG VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE  NOW, OR A MORE FANTASTIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT{DEVELOPMENT}.
Again we're so sorry that we are causing you  inconvience{inconvenience} regarding your plan and thank you for considering us.
And if someone elso{else} knew, I wouldn't be able to go back to  heaven unless I killed the person who told my secret.
Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing{following} them all the time.
And so far there weren't any discounts available which were said to be "available" in the advirtisement{advertisement}.
Actually I've been in an amature{amateur} photographer's organization for 3 years.
Then, after the Conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, wich{which} starts at 9:00 pm and finishes at 12:00 midnight.
The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaing{explaining} problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject.
Concerning the fashion of the future, I think it depends on  people's  personalities and they develope{develop} their own styles which suit them the most.
So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and having given the reasons, I expect to be able to count on your sense of responsability{responsibility}, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds I spent on that terrible night.
I'm shure{sure} that you are going to love it.
Furthermore I would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because I think it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the enveiroment{environment}.
For example, for a machine that lacks a "branch if greater or equal" instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction{pseudo instruction} that expands to the machine's "set if less than" and "branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction)".
You wrote  "visit our restaurant after the show" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant, but the reastaurant{restaurant} was closed because the show started at 20:15 and finissed{finished} at 00.15 and the restaurant was open until 00.00.
The enviroment{environment} will be very polluted and finally we'll get desease{disease}.
Yours sincierly{sincerely},
Firstly,  I read in the advertisment{advertisement} that the actor would be Danny Brook, and this is one of the reasons why I went to the theatre.
Furthermore, I was shooked{shocked} when one of the main actors came onto the stage.
In fact it wasn't a real house, it was some stones between the trees in the littel{little} forest neear{near} our house.
Life is too short to think about  poscesives{possessives}.
I don't understand the problem between your advertisment{advertisement} and the reality.
There is a great opportunity to go there because  students need not pay anyting{anything}.
In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionnary{dictionary} because it's faster and you really find what you need.
In particular, going to the Museum and the Art Gallery will be a great oppotunity{opportunity} for all of us, as they are world-famous places in London.
Sometimes, there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queu{queue}.
It is very unusal{unusual}  to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SUCH A CAMP BEFORE AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWART{FORWARD} TO SPENDING TWO WEEKS THERE.
I think that is going to be more confortable{comfortable} for me due to the fact that I am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I can't take the risk of catching a cold because ,as you know, I'm going to start to work.
I have a really good freind{friend}, Pat who I trusted and counted on .
The activities I would like to do durring{during} these two weeks are basketball and swimming.
Also shopping makes people happier by costing a lot of money and it influnce{influence} even the economic situation more flexably{flexibly}.
Maybe they will also be your life patners{partners}.
Firstly, log cabins are more comportable{comfortable} than tents.
There are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and armonious{harmonious}", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
I'm writing  to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter, so referring to the question of when I would like to travel, I would like to go anytime during July, because I have to be back home in August, because I need to apply and get everithing{everything} sorted out, to go to college next September.
It's something absoletuly{absolutely} necessary for every action people perform.
It is amaising{amazing} the way as the fas the computer changes, the programas{programs} are mor{more} quick and more useful and practical.
Futhermore{Furthermore}, when you look aroud{around} the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which you want to buy.
Finally I would like to inform you that I have never had such an umpleasant{unpleasant} evening in my whole life.
I recive{receive} a paper in which I was told about a play you are putting on and of the advantages I would recive{receive} if I went to see it.
I chose to play baskelball{basketball} (I play in a club, I am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
I have once experienced having been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut{due} to heavy rain several years ago.
I was getting angry, but, finally, the show started and I became quiter{quieter}.
It wasn't a spokeperson{spokesperson} Kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage.
I would like to make some appoitments{appointments} about the event that I went to.
GREATING{GREETINGS} AND HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON
In conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a  UNKNOWN deal of responsability{responsibility} for us all to survive in the future.
I mean, it's still inbelivable{unbelievable}.
You do not have to wear  speciall{special} clothes.
If I lie to them or don't explain the plans that my friends and I have I won't be able to go out, and will have the responsability{responsibility} of looking after my brother when they aren't at home.

The charachter{character} whom I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering, the mistress.
I think that we will observe a few  slow changes in fashion, but I hope that new clothes will always be pleasent{pleasant} for people.
THAT FRIDAY, I KNEW THAT I HAD DISSAPROVED{DISAPPROVE} THE EXAM, AND PAT KNEW IT TOO.
Do you reccomend{recommend} me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well?

After considering your accomodation{accommodation} offers, I'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible.
So we did, but unforturnily{unfortunately} it was closed and I was so dissapointed{disappointed} about it, not only because we had expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actor of starring.
I like to catch fisch{fish} too.
It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement{entertainment} not only for teenagers but also for adults.

We had to wait over 40 minitues{minutes} and we couldn't enjoy dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show.
But what about the ques{queues} you have to join to pay for something just to find, when you get to the front, that they have to close the till and they ask you to move to the next till.
Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed for  mentenance{maintenance}.
The worst thing of all was that at the beggining{beginning} of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised.

That was very disapponted{disappointed}.
I was terribly ennoyed{annoyed}!
In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not with the accomodation{accommodation} so that I can decide how much I must have with me.
I would prefer to come in July I will be avaliabel{available} for the moment.
Afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so they could get knoe{know} theyr{their} personally.
Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe{wish} without this being strange.
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted{instead} that from around the world.
I would be greatful{grateful} if you could send me further information about details like how much money or what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me.
I am in doupt{doubt} as to what kind of clothes I have to bring with me.
This was only in the begining{beginning}.
Finally, I would like to tell you that I am asking for my money back, because I had an evening totally despleased{displeased}, completely different from what you had anouced{announced} in your advertisement.
I looked around and I relised{realised} a friend of mine was still in the sea, and fighting against the storm, trying to get to the shore.

When I go shopping, I alway{always} feel ashamed because I spend my parents' money.

Thoug{Though}, a few of us would like to consider the "London fashion and leisure show".
First the actor was a wery{very} average actor.
My marks weren't good enought{enough} to obtain my degree in Computer Science, and the exam session was finished.
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved{received} your letters and I am going on the trip.
I have been practcing{practising} tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16's U.S open tournament last summer.
I would like to inform you that we have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Laisure{Leisure} Show" and we have found it very interesting.
It should be done  so people can see how people in every corner of the world have theyr{their} own fun.
To sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient{convenient}.

This will be a great oportunety{opportunity}!

And I would like a refun{refund}.
As he closed his eyes, he started to travel along the dark paths of his councience{conscience}.
I had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocain{cocaine} using my cheques.
I am writing to express my dissapointment{disappointment} with the play "over the rainbow", which is showing at the Circle Theatre.
The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something  as a preseant{present} for myself.
The show started 45 minuts{minutes} late without any valid reasons!
The aim of this report is  to discribe{describe} the biggest building of our town.
Do you know I am amuzing{amazing} when it comes to playing tennis?
I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasent{pleasant} to do so.
I think that it will be dresses, and suits swewed{sewed} by the well-known tailors.

You must have a TV because you can liten{listen} about what  is happening in the world and you can see some places that you haven't been to.
It was quite a difficult assiment{assignment} but I got some very good experience.
Let's take the mobil{mobile} phone.
Children play with computers instead of the usuall{usual} toys.
I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount avaible{available}.
And on the other hand we also have a very important museum, and a very beatiful{beautiful} building in the school grounds, bowls them!!
However, technology has a bad influence on us - generally on our healf{health}.
Therefore, if avaliable{available}, can you pay my money back please?
Modern technology can't not transforme{transform} our daily life.
I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate{hesitate} to contact me.
When I was there I saw a very beatiful{beautiful} T-shirt.

Nowadays,  people are always buying anythings{anything} when maybe they don't need these things, but only buy them because they are in fashion.
Best riger{regards}.
The festival was excenent{excellent} in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.
The most increible{incredible} part was the laser show.
Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is "mobil{mobile}".
Secondly, the whole audience were waiting for the begining{beginning} of the play at 19.30 and it started at 20.15, so I would like to know why  you say one time in the advertisement and why  you do what you want.

I think I can handde{handle} it very well.
I start thinking about what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something apropiate{appropriate} no matter how much money  it costs.

With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access the Internet to comunicate{communicate} with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from us.

They can just turn on their dish mashiens{machines} and go to do something that they think more pleasant.
For exemple{example}, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
We are also enthusiastic about your sightseing{sightseeing} in bus and the River trip to Greenwich on Monday and visiting  the National Art Gallery on Wednesday.
The second thing is that when I neaded{needed} a phone card to call somebody I had to stand in a long queue.
And you need some imformation{information} from me.
As if this were not enough, once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance{maintenance}.
I look fordwad{forward} to hearing from you
I holp{hope} you've enjoed{enjoyed} my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon.
I was waiting for 45 minuts{minutes}.
You know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't weait{wait} to get to the frount{front} and they  try to go through very quickly.
Also, I used to assist my brother, who is a profecional{professional} photographer, so  I consider myself expirienced{experienced} fairly.
I was very disapointed{disappointed} to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true.
I wright{write} to complein{complain} about the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
So, in my opinion, new tecnology{technology} has changed, is changing and will change my daily life; I hope that afterwards my life will be better.
I've got other questions: wich{which} type of clothes do I have to bring?
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities in our daily life at school shoud{should} be filmed to give the other students an idea of what we usually do, not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time.
Techology{Technology} is always getting better.
It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, as was promised in the advertisment{advertisement}.
Modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible{indispensable}.
I am still studying at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the begining{beginning} of July.
After a few seconds of thought I went straigh{straight} to Pat.
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computing, make-up, languages, geographie{geography}, to culture and civilization.
I know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my suprise{surprise} it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
In the future life will be more artifitual{artificial} than it was .
Now then, how was this advertising, it was completely diffarent{different}.
It was brillian{brilliant}.
I would like to thank you onc{once} again for this great opportiunity{opportunity}.
Last Sanday{Sunday} my friends and I saw that advertisement about the play you were supposed to put on.
In particular the River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forwold{forward} to this.
The school is like a dungeen{dungeon} here.
To sum up, I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not alway{always} rely on it.
On your last day you could go to the sport-musseum{sport-museum}, which is great and famous around the world, or just go for a walk around Reconvillier Park.
There are eye-max cinema, museums, a garelty{gallery}.
After all, either had I neve{never} done this task before, or trained.
I receved{received} your letter and I'm happy to help you.
Futur{Future} students could appreciate coming if they could still do their sport.
Tairs{Tears} ran down my face as I admitted having stolen.
Therefore Japanese architects consider designing of use a lot of glass as much as they can in house and try not to create speparate{separate} dark rooms.
In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner after the musical because the restrant{restaurant} was closed.
First of all, we went to the theather{theater} to pick up our tickets.
Becaue{Because}
The advertisment{advertisement} promised us a perfect evening but it wasn't, so I would highly appreciate it if you could completely refund our tickets.
I don't like tinking{thinking} of my house or my life without all these facilities.
It seemed to sink into the sea, but fourtunately{fortunately}, the storm soon went away.
In spide{spite} of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
However, I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy{photography} activities are only for beginners.
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complaine{complain} to.
I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest{August}.
I think it wouldn't be possible for us to survive without  eclectric{electric} light.
I had to buy my dress, its accesories{accessories} and also clothes and souvenirs!
The area for parking, space for children to play or bus station near the mall are not really appropiate{appropriate}.
But there occure{occur} also problems if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive.
Nevertheless, after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restarrant{restaurant} and what did I see?
Chairs are not only part of the forniture{furniture}, they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where they are art objects.
It is amazing and sometimes amuzing{amusing} how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is.
Shopping is not always enjeyable{enjoyable}.
About accomodation{accommodation} I would prefer a cabin, because I suffer from alergic{allergic}, and I think a tent would not be very suitable for my health.
One could be when you go into a shop and you  find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive{expensive}, and you cannot afford to buy it.
It began when our mutual friend Martha ofered{offered} me the chance to help organise the concert.
They are human beings  and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity{privacy} and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymus{anonymous} and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
First I want to talk about the combuter{computer}.
I would call our days  days of great technologycal{technological} progress.
Therefore she had to do a lot of tramits to cancell{cancel} her credit cards and to change her plane ticket.
Greatefully{Gratefully}
Shopping is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays{nowadays}.
On the one hand, the Internet is often used for entertaiment{entertainment}, but on the other hand it's also used in different business and education processes.
SO, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "REALLY SPLENDID SCIENT{SCIENCE} FICTION BOOK" I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ "A WINDOW.."
Synethetic{Synthetic} have been created by scientis{scientist}.
The advertisement showed two actors but I was surprised to see as the main caracter{character} a different person.
You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writing to you has been the accummulation{accumulation} of exams during this month.
The performance started fourty{forty} five minutes late.

The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner{prisoner}.
As a postman, Peter had to deliver letters aroud{around} our little village.
This party is for the students so the  clouthes{clothes} won't be so formal.
Firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandale{scandal} magazine readers.
I saw an advertisement which made it seem very atractive{attractive} to me.
You can't go outside in peace, and there is always a crownd{crowd} of people who stand in front of your house waiting for you.
I gave information about correct ways to other places like tooletes{toilets} and medical points.
First of all, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest mounth{month} in the year, and the weather will be really nice.
I got a lot of autographes{autographs}.
Last week, during my holiday in London, I had the opportunity to see the show "Over the Rainbow" at the Circle Theathre{Theatre}.
There are so many monuments in California and so I will remember this holiday with my photographies{photographs}.
It was a very unpleasent{unpleasant} evening.
On the other hand, the effects that it has on our daily life are not always good as sometimes the technology goes wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disastrous accidents, for example: plane crashes, train crashes and the explosion of nuclears{nuclear} bombs.
Everything has changed: style, colour, qual{quality}.
But also I am not able to imagine my life without this nice way of reciving{receiving} news with help of it.
To be more technical and specific, we need a very flexible job, wich{which} gives us independence and allows us to stop working when we are not able to, for example during the exams period.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want I knew that there was going to be a concert in owr{our} city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, Oasis.
Famous people must enderstand{understand} that the journalists are doing their job.
Sometimes, a lot of people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate{imitate}.
Celular{Cellular} phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car has broken down on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth.
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOUSE{CLOSE} TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE COURNER{CORNER} OF MY STREET.
I suggest it would be very intresting{interesting} to meet artists from faraway and exotic countries.
Affinity groupings, spokescouncils{spokes councils}  and networking all have lead to the success of various large scale anti-war and anti-globalization mobilizations, (such as the protests against the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle, and the Bay Area shut-down{shutdown} during the start of the second Iraq war).
It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphear{atmosphere} but also show how they are as young people.
Now let me tell you about my sports preferances{preferences}.
At  university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint couse{because} I work in a bank and I have a baby.
I'm very happy about thisbecause I spent most of my scholl{school} life playing  sports, especially  basketball.
For activities, my first choise{choice} is basketball.
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone{no one} made an apologie{apology} for it!
In the advertisment{advertisement} it said ,,your perfect evening out!"
On the other hand, the main disadvantage is that using modern machines  can be very difficult for ederly{elderly} people; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries trained people  to use modern technologies.
I am not so fit and healthy, so I don't like to do activitily{activity}.
The best thing was that I learnd{learned} a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks.
I was responsable{responsible} for the sound .
That's so good when you have the money  to enjoy it but, appart{apart} from that, there are many problems.
After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands{restaurants} located at the New Castle  UNKNOWN enought{enough} for a one-day trip.
Furthermore the style of the clothes is going to be more crazy and individuell{individual} but there will still be enumerous{numerous} clothes for  conservative people.
You can inform all the students that they can take some tradional{traditional} food to the party.
Howe{How} are things going over there?
When all the money had gone from a bank, nobady{nobody} was there except Pat.
She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and as is usuall{usual} the girls from the last course became popular.
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep - you will see unforgettable views of a white toun{town}.
I would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and I would give students more chances to share  their fantazy{fantasy} at school.
If this continues to happen our life will be very misarable{miserable} as accidents happen all the time.
Lastly, I think that all these changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptedly{abruptly}.
It was so heay{heavy} that one of ower{our} teachers had to calm me down, because I was very angree{angry} with her.
About the accomodation{accommodation}, I would prefer a tent because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities.
After evrything{everything} that had happened we went to the hotel tipped and very affect.
But Pat, coming back hom{home}, told her mother everything.
The exhibition is caud{called} the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it takes place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London, From 10.00 till 19.00.
This is just a note to confirme{confirm} for you that I have recive{receive} your letter.
His destenation{destination} is to get a Marlin.
One minute later, Pat and half our classe{class} stod{stood} in 'the House' looking and laufing{laughing} at me and my flower soup.
I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailling{sailing} because I have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and I have had a really good training in water sports.
So that's why they have invented the telephon{telephone}.
As you already know, we are going to have an end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a short speech at the begining{beginning}, then there will be a buffet and a disco.
I am hearing to looking fermards{forward} from you.
But after this serville{servile} work I met Eminem.
Of course smoking isn't allowed in any part of the schol{school}.
That will make it defenitely{definitely} a successful video.
Therefore I am thinking of selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places, and changed my life for a new life: whithout{without} a car.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY EXPIERENCE{EXPERIENCE} HELPING AT THE POP CONCERT IN OUR TOWN?
I mean I don't think we'll change cars into aereoplanes{aeroplanes}...
Last week we had another demostration{demonstration} of this.
However, there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extreamly{extremely} important invention.
The media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campain{campaign} and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
I have just recieved{received} the letter, which lets me know that I have won the first prize.
She began to share that secrect{secret} with everybody, including the teachers.
A computer is a really claver{clever} machine.
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I have won first prize in your competion{competition}.
Otherwise I had to keep walking untill{until} the train started.
THE HYSTORICAL{HISTORICAL} MUSEUM
Sometimes you have to park your car in a futher{further} place then walk to the supermarket.
As you know, I'd never been to any activities as  a valunteer{volunteer} before.
Instead of going to the science museum, we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show, wich{which} is open on Tuesday, March 14, from 10 am to 7 pm.
When I go to bed, because there are many mosquitoss{mosquitoes}, I turn on a special machine with a battery-like thing in it which kills them.
I am so pleased that I won this prize that I cannot explain how greateful{grateful} I am.
Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an agressive{aggressive} employee refused to answer me.
I think in the near future we need to decide with the goverment{government} which  special place in the town  will be lefet{left} just as a comerical{commercial} area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
On the way home you want to pick up some milk from the shop and you have to waite{wait} on avarage{average} ten minute.
On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be enough confortable{comfortable} to apreciate{appreciate} the event.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show which the Circle Threatre{Theatre} is staging.
You can buy somethings{something} in a supermarket by only a mail order.
I looked at her and she became pale and suddently{suddenly} left the class.
Absolutely it was very dissapointing{disappointing} so I want my money back.
I am writing to you to thank you for your very good organisation of the International Arts Festival, where I spent two exellent{excellent} days recently.
It was closed because of the staff trainning{training}.
They will be comfotable{comfortable} clothes becaus{because} the main point for any caind{kind} of clothing is to be comfatable{comfortable}.
Furthemore{Furthermore}, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100.
I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW THANFUL{THANKFUL} I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE.
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw  another star that was completely different from  your brochar{brochure}.
I like his company, and we are happy when we are togheter{together}.
I was able to ask anybody, and he answered in detail, althoug{although} he had a lot of work.
But when we think about it seriously, shopping is not enjoyable, for example, if you forget something that you need for a salat{salad}.
From a small village to the town was a very long way becouse{because}  people used a horse and wagon.
Sometimes, unfortunately shopping can be very annoying, especially at Christmast{Christmas} or Easter time.
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, I strongly reccomend{recommend} it for their excursion and because of their interests.
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly{badly} and you can't have it.
And if you never know money or you have less money shopping is not enjoyable for you I am choue{sure}.
This is the arrangement that we fouded{founded} with the other students and everyone agreed.
I REALLY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE I LEARNT A LOT OF TECNICAL{TECHNICAL} THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW; AND WHAT I ALSO ENJOYED WAS THE GOOD PAY!
The main characther{character} is the old man who has to fight against the sea to stay alive.
AS YOU KNOW, I AM A SOUND TECHNICH{TECHNICIAN}, SO I HELPED THEM TO SET UP THE SOUND EQUIPMENT AND THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY.
In the futur{future}, maybe in 2113, there will be houses like now but  with more technical things.
I congradulate{congratulate} you because that's perfect.
We all are interested in fashion and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity{opportunity} for us because students do not have to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour.
If I tell someting{something} in the college baby someone like or dislike about my story but I think my story it very good for someone.
All this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were qeuing{queuing} to pay.
Last week I recived{received} your letter in wich{which} you told me that I won first prize.
For pratical{practical} information, this show starts at 10.00 and closes at 19.00.

SINCE I HAVE A CHOICE OF ACCOMODATION{ACCOMMODATION}, I'LL DEFINETELLY{DEFINITELY} GO FOR THE LOG CABIN, BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR THE HEAT INSIDE A TENT.
I wonder if you could tell me about the wheather{weather} and what kind of clothes I ought to bring with me.
In order to know what sort of  clothes I have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this periode{period}?
Becouse{Because} you told us a lie.
You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart, the accomodation{accommodation} I would like to have and so on.
That makes me feel so embarrised{embarrassed}: I was very angry at that time!
We were together all day, painting the walls, cleaning and putting up some baloons{balloons} and other stuff everywhere.
I'm looking forword{forward} to hearing from you.
I do appologize{apologize} about that.
Yours faitfully{faithfully}

To hear the voice of the person you love is a feelling{feeling} that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real.
I have been driming{dreaming} about this activitie{activity} since I was 10 years old.
Swimming is my favourite way of excercise{exercise} and keeping fit.

I had a very disappointing evining{evening} last Saturday.
The restaurant should have been oppened{opened} when I came out, but it was closed because of the time the show finished.
THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWIN{FOLLOWING} FRIDAY, WICH{WHICH} WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS.
On top of everyting{everything}, the restaurant which was advertised in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged.
It is hard to imageine{imagine} what people will wear in 100 years' time, because since the 1900s clothes have reduce into smaller item and more preticle{practical}.
Secondly, although the log cabins appeal to me, I would prefer a tent because I think it is more comfortable and atractive{attractive}.
On the other hand, Hong Kong is known as a highly commerical{commercial} city, and you could find something different in Po Lin Temple.
This whent{went} on and on, got more and more serious, but it was so secret that the teachers didn't notice.
It means that every day exept{except} Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a "double lesson".
After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I concerne{concern}, the show must begin on time, but it started forty-five minutes late.
Technology will not stop growing  and helping people in the futur{future}.
Furthermore, you asked me to choise{choose} two activities I would like to do.

The big secret was that Anna was prearing{preparing} a suprice{surprise} party for her brother John and she didn't want anyone to know about it.
First of all, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed untill{until} 20.15, and when the show finally began we were supriced{surprised} to see that Danny Brook, who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was really disappointing.
Whateaver{Whatever} you do,  journalists should not follow you every second.
I stood at the entrance and theire{there} I had to check the tickets.
The programme offers enjoyment and education, which is  esencial{essential} for young people.
You were meant to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started very late at 20.15 p.m withour{without} any ecxpenetion{explanation} to the audience.
I don't want to be so evel{evil} about school but  rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school.
Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather{whether} there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies.
Immediantely{Immediately} after I heard, "And don't forget your homework".
There is nothing more disagreable{disagreeable} than that.
MY ADRESS{ADDRESS} IS IN THE ENVELOPE.
On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe{allow} us to get about quickly.

A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and enviromment{environment} problems are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries.
When the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who whork{work} ther{there}  don't wark{work} if they don't get their pay first.
Otherweise{Otherwise} I'll have to put some other ads out in London saying that your show is just a fraud!
Other workers are taking on other months so there is only July that is availible{available} for me.
After one mounth{month}, I went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun I had with my friends - I don't know why I was such a liar.
In this letter you ask me for some further information for my conveniance{convenience} for this trip.
What is more, admittion{admission} for students is free.
This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have developed such an instinc{instinct} for shopping that we can proudly say that we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle.
Amaisingly{Amazingly}, we can find that there are more and more computer users.
I think that some of the changes have been very good, like the impruvement{improvement} in  medical science, which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives.
Modern life  has been full of science and tecnologies{technologies}.
In addition, it was  nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and houndreds{hundreds} of Coblights in the right place.
In addition to that, people will always be affraid{afraid} of a technological war.
I expect human beings will live on  other planets and trevel{travel} around under the sea.

In conclusion, I can say that this is not the biggest problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse{because} I am not famous!
The activities that I would like to do are singing, because my friend told me that I'm good at it, and the other activitie{activity} that I would like to do is climbing because I think it is very exciting although I have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
If you bought something goregous{gorgeous}, you will be very happy.

I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the anual{annual} sports turnament{tournament} or wellcoming{welcoming} evening for new students.

I think you should definetly{definitely} go and I'll try to help in any way I can.

My life is much easier with all this stuff mentioned above - tecnology{technology} and science.
But  during any peak season, like Christmas holidays or even during weekends, then I can say I definatly{definitely} don't feel it is enjoyable, because of the crowds.

Also in the advertisment{advertisement} you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink.
In our Acadamy{Academy} we are not allowed to smoke.
It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms{programmes} with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival.
A especiall{especial} invitation
Mr. Maneger{Manager},
I think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of  show, for instance  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to have propiate{appropriate} hairstyles.
We shouldn't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially if we take into  consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear{Shakespeare}.
We really started to work like ants the morning befor{before} the show.
I'm crayz{crazy} about tennis and swimming.
The answer was always the same: "Imposible{Impossible}".
Both were very hanson{handsome}, played football; they were an example for everybody.
Last week during my holiday in London, I found your advertisment{advertisement} in my newspaper.
Even in cars and washmachines{washing machines} there're computer chips.
Please could you informy{inform} me what  you meen{mean} when  you say all the accommodotion{accommodation} is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that I know how mutch{much} money I have to bring with me, and what kind of wather{weather} it is during this period of the year so that I know what kind of clothes I have to take.
I'm very glad to be able to help you out with such a sutiation{situation}.
But I hope that next year visitores{visitors} to the festival will be able to be introduced to more art groups from all over the world.
The wind was blowing and the heavy rain was drumming agaist{against} our bedroom window.
It said in the leafet{leaflet} that this would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
However I was really suprised{surprised} that the entrence{entrance} fee was so low.
I would advise you to visit our zoo or to go for a picnik{picnic} in a park befor{before} you go to the party.
The home of the Futere{Future}
This was the reason whe{why} we were in horrible trouble with the police.
First of all, modern technology has changed my daily life in the last five years more quickly than in  anchient{ancient} times, or even than a decade ago.
In the following you can find, I hope, all the information you need to complete the partecipation{participation} procedure.
How can we go out wearing thouse{those} clothes?'
We ar{are} looking forward to your reply.
succed{succeed} at a good level.
At the begining{beginning} I was very angry but in the end I said that everything was O.K.
About the accomodation{accommodation}, I rekon{reckon} I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable.
Regarding  the accomodation{accommodation}, I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to  nature.
Another paht{point} is the tickets.
It is so because you are young and need to make your life as intrestng{interesting} as it can be now.
People used to wear very diffrent{different} things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that they are 'clothes'.
For example, emagine{imagine} that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit.
I THINK THE VIDEO WOULD ENCOURGE{ENCOURAGE} STUDENTS TO DO SPORTS AND BE GOOD ATHLETS{ATHELETES}.
I'm not used to hight{high} temperatures.
It seems to me that all these failures were your falt{fault}, because you were responsible for the organisation of the show.
I was truly dissapointed{disappointed} by it.
I want to complain about your advertisment{advertisement} for the production 'Over the Rainbow'; I had a very disappointing evening.
And we preciate{appreciate} your not telling him about our party.
Wherever you go everyone would love you because of your troussers{trousers}, which would clean away all the rubbish that is on the road.
If you have never been there, I really recemmend{recommend} you to go.
Other students work as house or office managers, make promontion{promotion} of different goods or even work as  bouncers.
Because of it our state can't pay  workers in schools, hospetols{hospitals}, on building sites.
You recommended  the resturant{restaurant} after the show.
In my opinion you ought to be more serious because of the commitent{commitment} you have to entertain  the people who come to your theatre.
Look at the history books for 400-600 years ago, or even for the time of the First and Second World Wars, to see how  sociaty{society} has changed, just because we  stepped up  the advance of science and technology.
I like Danny Brook very much, and his unaspected{unexpected} absence caused  me  great sadness.
Secondly, I would prefer an accomodation{accommodation} in a tent because I enjyoi{enjoy} being outside close to  nature.
I would like to ask you how much money  I need, how the weather is, in order to pack the necessary clothing, and wheter{whether} I need anything else.
This would be very easy to mantage{manage} but it would mean no more shopping for girls.
We live sorrounded{surrounded} by inventions wich{which} help as through the day.
In the last fifty years  human tecnologies{technologies} have grown  exponensially{exponentially}.
I worked 12 hours per day but alwalys{always} with fun people.
That means for exampel{example}, while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll{control} your home with the computer.
It seems to be incredible, but it's commun{common} habits for us..
Anyway, intstead{instead} of going shopping in the afternoon session, we will attend the show.
Before the concert I helped with carring{carrying} and putting in order some chairs on which some special people would sit.
I used my computer  to collect reports from the Internet and I can promise I found so much information that I couldn't analize{analyse} it in two weeks.

But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the resaurant{restaurant} after the show.
Finally about my oppinion{opinion} I wish we would dress  more as we did in the past, using natural matrial{material}.
I think this topic is so exciting from the antropological{anthropological} and psicological{psychological} point of view, because we can studie{study} the subject's reactions before, during and after  shopping.
Some people may argue, but I think, that politicions{politicians} and films-stars{film stars} belong to the public.
We have noticed the environmential{environmental} damage in recent years.

I'm writing to you to complain about the disappointing expirience{experience} I had with your theatre.
Although I'm not very good at surfing I like it, and I always practis{practise} on my holidays every year.
Because of this situation I will be very busy in the first week of July, and I would apreciate{appreciate} it if you could give me the option to begin my "Camp California" experience on July 10th.
We have seen an advertisment{advertisement} for the London Fashion and Leisure Show in a newspaper.
check your  wallet and if you have enough money (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Phili{Chile}, Cuba, Zambania{Zambia}, and Morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for ôsmallö jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and ôfind yourselfö
When I was a child I never liked to go shopping because my Mum spent so much time in the shops that I remember that going shopping with her was a nigthmare{nightmare}.
For the second activity I would like to enrol in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient surfer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwile{worthwhile} trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners' group.
There were also the discounts wich{which} weren't available.
The sun was shining, the Chanel{Channel} was clear blue and I was walking by the sea.
What I really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and  make-up , because I learnt how to do make-up for someone and I spent a few minutes with the most popular grup{group} in the world.
Pat appologized{apologized} to me for not keeping my secrets.
A few weeks ago, me and my farmily{family} had a hoilday{holiday} in London.
I'd like to tell you that the best month for me to travel to the U.S.A. is  July because I will be on hollidays{holidays} in that month.
And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fasion{fashion} and Leisure Show till 19.00.
Yours Sincelery{Sincerely},
From the 10 opitions{options} that I have to choose from I will choose two, climbing, wich{which} I have been praticing{practising} for three years  because  I know it by heart, and swimming wich{which} I have also been doing every day as part of my daily rotine{routine} in Portugal.

I am writing to you, because I would like to disagree with your advertisment{advertisement} for the show 'over the Rainbow'.
I would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so I can bring with me the appropiate{appropriate} clothes and the last thing I need to know is the amount of money that I have to bring with me.
So, the next day, I nervously came to Pat's appartment{apartment} where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen.
Going  shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it also has many disavantages{disadvantages}.
I had to pay the full price for them, which was quite expencive{expensive}.
There is only one bad fhing{thing}, that this festival was too short.
Thank you for your letter, as usual, it's a pleisure{pleasure} to receive  news from you.
In addition to this, I would like to know the ammount{amount} of money I should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that I could need and the sort of people that I will find there.
Reserches{Research} has shown that almost every single household owns a PC.
You can imagine how dissappointed{disappointed} I felt after that evening, and I am writing to ask you for a  refund of part of the money.
There will be shown the latest fashions, leisure- and sportwear{sportswear}, some make-up and also different hairstyles.
I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional{additional} information.
It is not far aways{away}.
I want to know if I can take my celular{cellular} phone, too.
In my opinion the hall for the rock concets{concerts} was too small.
Given the circumstances, I would like to learn more about Photograhy{Photography} and painting.
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armores{armours} and, we are especially pround{proud} of it, the great collection of swords.
Me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when I understood what was happing{happening} on the stage, I decided to help them.

Because of all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definatly{definitely} one of the worst.
Donnot{Do not} forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have the chance to change them.
It turned out to be impossible: the restaurant was closed and we didn't even receive an explaination{explanation} therefor{therefore}.
Now we are in the 20th centure{century}  in which people have been to the moun{moon} and discavered{discovered} madesons{medicines} aboute{about} siriale{serial} illneses{illnesses}.
I don't know why I paid £20 with no discount, which the advertisements said I woul{would} have.
Furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunetly{unfortunately} this fact especially has changed my life.
Surprizingly{Surprisingly} there was a completely different actor starring.
Futermore{Furthermore}, I am going to enter a competition next year.
The dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their moviments{movements}.
And is there anything eles{else} I have to take with me?
You can't buy something in a peacful{peaceful} and calm athmospher{atmosphere}.
She answered  becouse{because} all this year you have been so irritable that you got angry with everybody who tried to talk to you," and the other friends had convinced her to dump me.
Also the Iternet{Internet} has an influence on my daily life, beause{because} I can find there many interesting things, or I can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS{DEVELOPMENTS} OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIED A CATHEGORY{CATEGORY}.
I have recently recieved{received} your letter saying that I have won the first prize in the competition.
I'm a profesional{professional} and I have to be good at it, in any time.
Yours Sincererly{Sincerely},
Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or "green" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noize{noise} are the main problems of our society.
In a nutchel{nutshell} I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed.
Also the sports activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school life and can be useful to show  the moviments{movements} of the bodies during the atletics-school{athletics-school} events.
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO DESCRIBE MY DESAGREABLE{DISAGREEABLE} EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE  LAST SATURDAY, AT YOUR SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW".
When the show started Danny Brook was not acting, which was a great dissapointment{disappointment} for us both.
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased that I won the first prize in your compition{competition}.
However, those days were unforgatable{unforgettable} for me.
Dear Sir or Mam{Madam},
Appart{Apart} from calling them, I also helped build  the stage, and took care of the lights.
In the advertisement it said that discounts were availble{available}, but when I asked a member of staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one.
Sally, although she knew about it,  seemed very suprised{surprised}!
The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programm{programme} which you have organised for our trip to London.
I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murther{murderer}!
I belive{believe} that modern technology has affected possitive{positive} our lives.
As far as I know accomodation{accommodation} at Camp California is in tents or log cabins.
As well as that, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowaday{nowadays}, however, it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport and everything you have to do.
I have chosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team, and photography is my favoorate{favourite} hobby.
About a millenium{millennium} ago everything was different;  people didn't have electricity, they cooked their food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
At school it is completely different because the teachers don't foregive{forgive} you anything.
So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely agressive{aggressive}.
I am looking forward to receiving your answer and don't forget that it is a surprice{surprise} birthday party.
It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like you are flaing{flying}.
Apart from this, the teachers were very experienced and the equipment was particullarly{particularly} coteporary{contemporary}.
Besides all those improvements and confort{comfort} I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us.
The two activities that I prefer are Basketball, because I  played in my school's team for almoust{almost} a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I have done since I was ten.
Of course, what  was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and I would be very greatful{grateful} if you could refund me the price of my ticket.
The best way is definetely{definitely} by air.
In the early 90s it was in fashing{fashion} for  women to wear only skirts, long ones actually, and for men to wear trousers.
Finally, everyone should slow down his own life's rythm{rhythm}.
This little essay shows that I depend on technology and, moreover, because I'm in an electronic eegenering{engineering} school, I'm keen on technology.
Could you, please send me some extra information regarding the ammount{amount} of money I should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes I should take.
We stayed  with a host family in a surburb{suburb} of the city.
When the musical finished I was terribly hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment{advertisement} said that it would be open.
Sara was a very good puple{pupil}.
Despite my being a student and the advertisement saying that discounts were available, I was refused  a half-price ticket, and the explaination{explanation} 'why' wasn't sufficiant{sufficient}.
We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons becase{because} the teachers think that we are chatting.
Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the grup{group} in their room for a few minutes.
Warm whishes{wishes}
I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpul{helpful} for you to prepare for the next festival .
I am writing to inform you about the differences between your advertisment{advertisement} and the real show.
I particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violen{violin} etc, which was really great, and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want.
This framing device expands the potential for using cross-time fiction to compare different outcomes uptime, downtime and crosstime{cross time} all at once.
Of course, you shoud{should} give a refund for the money spent, not only to me but to all the audience.
I am writing to you because I am really dissapointed{disappointed} about "Over the Rainbow" which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized.
The theatre restaurant was closed after the show, they said funds had runn{run} out.
Unfortunately, it wasn't and we couldn't afford bying{buying} everyone a ticket.
He wasn't Danny Brook, one of the resons{reasons} for my choice of coming to see Over the Rainbow.
Finally, I would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come  a long way don't have to spend money on accomodation{accommodation}.
The organisers paid for my acommodation{accommodation} and flight to Ireland.
One of the most important things we have to film is our bycicle{bicycle} classes.
The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals, sports, museums, ect{etc}.
It gaves{gives} me the posibility{possibility} to know more about things I never knew about.
Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funy{funny}.
Now I have the opurtuanity{opportunity} so I shall inform you fully.
In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, and you mustn't eat chuingham{chewing gum} or take a Walkman with you.
Moreover there will be a demostration{demonstration} of  modern make-up and new different, shaking hairstyles.
I have done it once a mounth{month} since I was 17.
I exchange corespondecies{correspondences} with all my family via the Internet, with my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and also with a brother who lives in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand.
I saw your advertisment{advertisement} for your show at the circle theatre, over the rainbow.
We decided to go to his place (I've got a copy of the key) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounch{lounge}, then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived.
It would be beutiful{beautiful} if you would agree to change your plan.
I belived{believed} everything she told me.
Thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three-day programm{programme} in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the National Art Gallery.
Surprisingly, there were no discounds{discounts}.
I don't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California, but if I can tell you wich{which} one I prefer I'll choose to stay in a tent.
Especailly{Especially}, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap.
Nyremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different expirience{experience} and a lesson too.
We build big cities, there is hot and cold water, electricity, gas in particulary{particularly} every home.
How delighted I was when I receved{received} your letter!
First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can get to know artists who cames{comes} from different countries.
I hope that the enviroment{environment} will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be.
It became scencial{essential} to doing my homework.
Everybody attented go to the show, funny, and happ{happy} in the end, and what have we go then?
She appears occationaly{occasionally} and opens every window in the castle.
In a suppermarket{supermarket}, shop or department store they have many things.
In particular, I liked cleaning the stage, because I could stand on a famouse{famous} singer's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm, even though I had to clean it.
One day when I was there alone, I heard some other kids aproting{approaching}.
One of the essential developement{development} has been in our means of transportation.
Although I imagine them in my house in my future, I am sure I would be suprised{surprised} if I had them.
On the other hand, I am aware of all the disadvantages of  modern technology; pollution and the dangarous{dangerous} it brings.
The comunications{communications} over the world is faster than ever, so when I need something, I can have it in only a minute.
This book helps us to impove{improve} our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
Ofcoure{Of course} secrets can be different...
Another disadvatage{disadvantage} of the festival's programme was the lack of plays and films which are the best  to display a modern country's culture, I think.
We have already orgonised{organised} our visit in a new programme.
To begin with, every morning Pat said a pleasant "hello" and added to that a big smail{smile}.
Also there are some free handphones{headphones} that explain the history of the museum.
One day I decided to tell my best freind{friend} - Pat, who I realio-on{relied on} .
After that "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand{restaurant} but what a surprise!
That's the most suitable accomodation{accommodation} for a camping holiday.
In conclusion, I'd like to recoment{recommend} that you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it.
There are five diffrent{different} floors, each of them presents a diffrent{different} chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Juisus{Jesus} and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
I ask you to transfor{transfer} money into this account.
The perfect evening you promised in your advertisment{advertisement} was the complete opposite and that is why I want to get some money back from you.
This technology has helped to make my life easier and more exciting, but like everithing{everything} it has had some negative aspects.
Well my friend, I have to go, because I have got an appoinment{appointment} with the Dentist.
As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperations{inspirations} that we get from all sorts of enviroment{environment}.
Maybe some people will be nakid{naked}.
The show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisment{advertisement} .
This is an International student party, so I suggest you wear tradional{traditional} costume.
I am very happy to hear from you that I have won first prize in your competition - twe{two} weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. and I am writing  to tell you my information.
A desaster{disaster}!
Maybe the eason{reason} for that is very simple: lack of money?
But Pat could not resist the temptention{temptation}  to call the police.
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment{advertisement}, I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and make some suggestions for next year's festival that you might take into consideration.
I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossam{blossom} tree.
I know this word is not the best but you have demostrated{demonstrated} that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business.
I think the next time you write an advertiment{advertisement} you should put in  the right information.
We were stedy{study} in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well.
The most suitable time for shopping is the weekand{weekend} when parents don't work and children haven't got  school.
When I asked for the price I was surprised becaused{because} the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
"Um{I'm} very unhappy that I have to write you this letter.
Service: It is over 100 years old but it is kept in  good condition by the local people, who are proude{proud} of this castle.
All the students would be very greatful{grateful} .
We are always trying to have more things, which lead us to neglect our family, our future, and other things which are probably more important than a new perfum{perfume}.
I think going shopping in a big spaise{space} like Harrodss is not a plesure{pleasure}, because it's crowded with people.
Everybody  had gone to buy luch{lunch} in the supermarket.
All syntetic{synthetic} material will be uncomfortable for these people.
Finally, I was thinking of having dinner in the threatre{theatre} restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees.
Tecnology{Technology}, are we prepeared{prepared} for these advances?
But in spite of all of these desadventages{disadvantages} , I was folling{following} my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything I was going to do it.
SUBJECT: Recomnendations{Recommendations} for a place to visit
The show supposted{supposed} to start at 19.30 pm but it started at 20.15 pm.
I am writing to complaine{complain} about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting "Over the Rainbow".
We would like to inform you that we are all extremely interested in this show and that it could be a great opportunity for us because  entrance is free for  studends{students}.
For example, we can't go to the toliet{toilet} during  lessons.
I find it very anfair{unfair} for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
You said that some discouns{discounts} were available.
I think it is verey{very} convenit{convenient} for the group.
So I am asking you: why do you adverstise{advertise} it if is not going to be available to the audience?
Firstly I want to congratualate{congratulate} you on the festival.
Another significant technological developement{development} is the invention of electrical appliances.
Then we can have a rest in the caffee{cafe} and talk before your flight home.
I am going to wear classic black trousers and a white jorsey{jersey} - it might be that this information gives you some idea too.
However, technology nowerdays{nowadays} impoved{improved} so much and it has changed our lives a lot.
I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all the promises that were made in the advertisment{advertisement}.
Maybe they will be in many colours and they will be very thight{tight}.
First of all, when I bought the ticets{tickets} it appeared that there was no discount available.
I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergie{allergy} to grass.
I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when sudently{suddenly} a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour.
So therefore, my choise{choice} to ask her about my decision was the best thing I could do.
I'd like you to send the money to this adress{address}: ul Taklowa 10

Suddenly they all shouted "suprise{surprise}!".
As I was so looking foreward{forward} to seeing Danny's performance, I was very disappointed.
Anyway I enjoed{enjoyed} it so much.

Another succesfull{successful} carreer{career} such as, film stars must also be balanced.
It looks fragil{fragile} and it could break easily.
It then becomes a real obsession for the average student, as e{he} uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations...

Concernet{Concerning}  acomodation{accommodation}, I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or on an excurcion{excursion} it isn't  the same if I sleep in a cabin.

Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sound better and the pictures on TV are being impoved{improved}, because the machines become better.
It is worthes{worth} tp{to} spend time and money on that.
I hope you preciate{appreciate} my letter and that you'll try to amend these problems./

In my opinion, nowdays{nowadays}, shopping is very easy and at the same time very hard.
I'm sure you are jalous{jealous} now.
Othrewise{Otherwise}, there are people who think the opposite, such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they hardly ever go shopping -  only when they need clothes, or something for their job or school.
I think that these kinds of people have a poor life because they can never be quiet because all the poeple{people} knows them and wants to know a lot of things about them.
It would be a great plessure{pleasure} to spend two weeks at Camp California and I can't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm.
We arrived on time but the  show was delayed untill{until} half-pass{half-past} eight.

It's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had chosen it, because I'm (alowed{allowed}?).
HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY{DAILY} LIVES?
Also, we expected to get a discount as  students, but international students cards are not valid in your theatre (that is very strange - even your advertisment{advertisement} has  information about discounts).

If we are talking about accomodation{accommodation} then accomodation{accommodation} in tents would be great - I love being close to  nature.

In the advertisement you say that there is a biscount{discount} available but there was not.
The shopping centres are always busy, with people going up and down carrying bags and looking in shop windows; it seems everbody{everybody} is happy.

The  reasonably-piced{priced} package, including tickets and accomodations{accommodation}, well suited my personal situation: comfortable rooms that are easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide  at the last minute.
I hope that this will claryfy{clarify} your questions and doubts.
My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computers or mordern{modern} technology.
Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the TV, the microwave, the video, the satelite{satellite} dish, the CD player and hundreds of others.

I would like to know how much money  people ussually{usually} take and how much clothing.
It is wonderful how  tecnology{technology} makes things so easy.
I'm quite good at paiting{painting} and I play tennis.
If not, what do you sugest{suggest}?
The teacher sent me to talk with the principal, who suspended me for using  bad maners{manners} with a girl.
The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it actually started at 20:15 due to a probleme{problem} with the sound.
I like to go window shopping that is good to go arround{around} the shopping centre.
These days people prefere{prefer} shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money.

I sometimes have trouble with backache when I coud't{couldn't} sleep on a flat surface.
Firstly, I arrived five hours before the begining{beginning} of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the equipment from the van to the stage.

Your visit to the shop conludes{concludes} in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account.
Yours Sincirley{sincerely}
I like this kind of holliday{holiday}.
In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque{League}.

Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery{jewellery}, anything.
I phoned  the tourist information office last week and I got some information about the accomodation{accommodation} for the students.
It evoques{evokes} the reason for our presence here and it is a cliché; that cannot lack.
Lastly, there is a recyling{recycling} problem, which many people do not care about.
But for their considerations, they're working in their rutines{routines}.
I would like to go in July, I don't mind wich{which} two weeks, but it has to be that month because in June I am still in school and in August I am going on holiday with my family.
My hands were sclumbling{trembling} but I did it very well.
Secondly, I would prefer my accomodation{accommodation} to stay in a log cabin, because I am alergic{allergic} to some insects that might get in a tent.
The reason I write to you is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, for a fiew{few} days.
Nowadays, in the year 2000 we still practise this ancient art but in a diferent{different} way, we don't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more, we go shopping.
When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked{choked} with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident.
I love motocycles{motorcycles} and I don't think I could live without them.
Anyway, shopping is allways{always}  satisfation{satisfaction} for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in Aougust{August} to earn money and after that (from September to June) I go to university as usual.
Maybe it would contine{continue} reduceing{reducing} in 100 years to come.
I will never ever help anybody to organice{organise} a pop concert again.
Everything was going perfectly befor{before} last month when I met a girl from the other school.
The day of the party everyone had fun, especially Pat who at the beggining{beginning} was sad.
They will be sinthetic{synthetic} clothes, I think, made of plastic or something similar."
I am really greatful{grateful} to the people who invented the first motocycle{motorcycle} in the world.
For  men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of money  buying clothes, cosmetics, accesories{accessories}, jewellery etc.
And referring to the question about wich{which} type of accommodation I prefer, I choose a log cabin, because I think that a tent is messier, so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin.
First of all, I belive{believe} that if someone has time to go to the shops has the possibility.
The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an adversitement{advertisement} on  TV.
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come frome{from}.
The show is on Tuesday, March 14th, from 10.00-19.00 in the Central Exibition{Exhibition} Hall.
It happened on a very lovly{lovely} day in summer.
Unfortuneatly{Unfortunately}, Daniela fainted.
However, we are not friends anymore because of a secrect{secret} in the past.
The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show  to eat something, was closed without any explaination{explanation} and the perfect evening was completely imperfect.
I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout{without} reading the book more than once.
I stayed with him until the concert began and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers{dancers}.
I have been hearing about the Ave they have in the Exivicuion{Exhibition}, it is interesting.
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed{practised} before.
The band "Three Kings" apresented{presented} a new stily{style} of music.
I couldn't believe that I had met that superstar who was dancing in front of a crouded{crowded} soccer stadium.
At the bigging{beginning} I was conecting{connecting} all these wires into spekers{speakers}, music system, guitars etc...
I do recommend paying attention to the food in the cafeteria because, even though it was not the main subject of this report, they also wrote complaning{complaining} about it.
It is not allways{always} easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them.
I can try all the shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and jakect{jackets} on.
About the accomodation{accommodation}, as I read, you can offer me a log cabin or a tent.
I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches{toothbrushes} in the bags.
Nowdays{Nowadays} motorization is one of the most important inventions.
For instance with the arrival of the Internet, the new digital television and the researchers in  medecin{medicine}, we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a botton{button}, or look for something new by only thinking about it... we realize that the new technology  has just begun to advance, and it is likely in a few years we will be very avanced{advanced} in this way.
I asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your tv on this date, chanel{channel} three, and you will see me there playing  this guitar.
First, we couldn't get a discount, although you mention it in your advertisment{advertisement}.
The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast with itselves{themselves}.
They started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew{threw} their balloons as far as they could.
I look farward{forward} to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me my money back.
I would definitely choose basketball and swimming wich{which} are  my dream sports.
People now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leassure{leisure} time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home.
Apart from that, the show started at 20:15, not at 19:30, as it  said in the advertisment{advertisement} and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished.
I will be having my exams durind{during} this month, so I can't travel before July.
Nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your house, your school, ofice{office} or any place you can be in a city.
It's comletely{completely} different!
Conversely, painting is an activity wich{which} I have never tried before, so  I have not any skill in drawing but I would like to start doing that now when I have the chance.
After all these problems I became dissappointed{disappointed} because it was only a week's holiday in London.
I WANT TO THAK{THANK} YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US ON THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH.
I didn't beleive{believe} him at first.
However, I could enjoy it, even though I was a biginner{beginner}, so I would like to practise and have fun at the camp.
They also gave me a ticket to wotch{watch} the concert live.
I must say though, I would have to travel in July because it's the summer holydays{holidays} for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible.
Nowdays{Nowadays} everyone has a telephone.
Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secreats{secrets} from anyone, even himself.
I bought two tickets for £20 and when I asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then I was kept waiting for the show to start untill{until} 8:15 pm.
To sum up, as far as I am concidered{concerned}, modern technology has changed my life completely.
By contrast, in the future, I guess we would rather go back to the acient{ancient} time, owing to have natural life style.
As far as I am concerned, I would prefer an accomodation{accommodation} in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tent as well.
As I see I have the chance to choose the accommodation I prefer, I would like to stay in a tent because I used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem I could be very confortable{comfortable} in a log cabin too.
I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival wich{which} is a great idea.
So he crimbed{climbed} on the radder{ladder} up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there "what happened?"
However, we saw an advertisment{advertisement} for "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go and see it.
We are intrsted{interested} in politicians' and film stars' clothes, hobbies, passions and  intrigues.
About the accomodation{accommodation}, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have a bad back and I think that sleeping in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me.
Every electronic gadget in the futur{future} home will be able to comunicate{communicate} with other machines or computers.
THIS CAN BE BAD TOO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BEING CONFORTABLE{COMFORTABLE}, WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORK I WON'T BE ABLE TO .
Unfortunately your advertisment{advertisement}  said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later.
As you can see, there are some (volontary{voluntary}?) mistakes in the advertisment{advertisement} you made.
However, 15% thougth{thought} that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.
And I would like to make sure that he  relly{really} loved me.
If you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during  your journey and you won't be alway{always} luky{lucky} enough to find a seat .
Also as producing new electoronic{electronic}, our home of the future will be more convinient{convenient}.
On the other hand, I would like to know some imformation{information} wich{which} could be useful on my holiday like: what type of clothes would be more suitable for me in the Camp?
I knew that but I needed someone who could understent{understand} and support me at that moment.
For what concernes{concerns} the activities, I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me.
Peter and Sue asked  Francis for some help with their exam subjets{subjects} and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.

The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil's attituds{attitudes} to the video they have to make and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
I would like to know  how many peopl{people} will stay with me in the tent, and do I have  to take with me any special clothes for  surfing.
More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper{compare} to travelling by public transport.
First of all they talk about the enviroment{environment} pollution which cars and other vechicles{vehicles} create, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other problems.
MY NAME is JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS{COMPLAINTS} REGARDING THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT.
From the beggining{beginning} it was all a disappointment.
I think it is now the futur{future} of  big companies  to work with the Internet.
Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm{programme} of my school, which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July.
To sum up, all the improvements come at a price: the condition of the environement{environment}.
The programme is very exating{exciting} and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich.
It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time: herself and the houskeeper{housekeeper}.
Yours senciarly{sincerely}
Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if I am not at home; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music; I use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, ect{etc}.
In fact, modern technology was already very popular and comonly{commonly} used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life suddenly.
If you have this oportunitty{opportunity} one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like this just to get a free pass.
I am very disappointed because the things that were written in the advertisment{advertisement} were not really true.
It seems like a good oportunity{opportunity} to practise it.
Architecuture{Architecture} with use of glass brough{brought} us  modenism{modernism} in 1980.
But the computer has a bad sead{side} too.
Therefor{Therefore} I wouldn't change anything in my home life  or in my school life.
More and more people die from some illnesses wheres{whereas} a long time ago fewer people died from the same illnesses, dispite{despite} the fact that they had fewer medisent{medicines}.
About accomodation{accommodation}, I prefer  tents to log cabins.
Secondly, my choise{choice} is the accommodation in tents.
At the begining{beginning} I would like to thank you.
I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfrendly{unfriendly} people who are too busy.
I apprieciate{appreciate} these shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
I don't like cold nights and moscitos{mosquitoes}.
In my view, it was extremely interesting and satisfing{satisfying} for me all the concert long.
The musical show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it started t{at} 20:15.
In answer to your question, I wouldn't change anything because I think that these are the minimum rules that a theenager{teenager} has to have to be responsable{responsible} in the future.
I would not dare to culculate{calculate} how much I have spent on those things without thinking.
That was why our great plan for our horiday{holiday} was not be real.
The weekend came and that Friday we went to the dyscoteque{discotheque}.
I am writing to you because last night I expected to have a wonderful evening and unfortunately I was disappointed a lote{lot}.
July is also good because the wethear{weather} is warm and I could enjoy mor{more} the time that I will spend in the camp.
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, wich{which} took place in your stablishment{establishment}, The Circle Theatre, which made me feel very upset.
However, the point that I am trying to make is that you just ruined my hoilday{holiday}.
By the way, the end-of-conference party is a kind of fairwell{farewell} party.
The modern technologies mean I am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a reproductor, I can carry this music  everywere{everywhere}.
However, it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable, for example before Christmas or during some special salles{sales}.
If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven{oven}.
Firstly, the enviroment{environment} is polluted because of technology, although this is our fault.
I am looking forward to my holiday, which begins on the first of July lasting until twenty-first July, so it is possible  travell{travel} at this time.
If I find somenthing{something} special you will be able to visit in three hours I will call you.
If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever{wherever} he is I will be able to get through to him.
This made Nick very embrassed{embarrassed} and he felt hurt.
When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect{defect} on it and have to go back to the store to complain.
We can also show one of de{the} youngest classes and at the end one of de{the} oldest.
Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expensise{expenses} money to spend?
I desided{decided} to go to your theatre but at the beginning it was the tranbles.
Regarding your  last question I can sugest{suggest} visiting the Royal Castle.
What's more, your letter said about the chance to do  two acctivities{activities} during the camp.
But after they seperated{separated}, he told his friends her secrets without thinking.
BUT THE MAIN PURPOUSE{PURPOSE} OF THE BOOK IS TO ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW  LIFE IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE, WHEN, PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE RULED BY MACHINES.
I have only one question about the baby's accomodation{accommodation}.
Even though I think most of the time it is very interesting, sometimes it gets people upsent{upset}.
We are extremaly{extremely} interested in wisiting{visiting} London.
The advertisment{advertisement} also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
There will be clothes for everyone's tast{taste}.
In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting{interesting}, and in my opinion, some of the concert halls were too small.
All  day I speak with the majority of my collegues{colleagues} by telephone or e-mail.
However, drawing some beautiful sceanary{scenery} and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me.
After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and, you know, it was incredibale{incredible} because some people slept all  night in front of the stadium to be in the front row.
Regarding the acomodation{accommodation}, I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest.
Our department, which is the sales department, have to make good sales results befor{before} the end of June because of the financial month.
The conneat{connect} between students and their teachers or principals is very poor!
I am not used to sleeping in a tent and I think it mabey{maybe} ruen{ruin} my holiday.
After the show I was not surpised{surprised} at all to learn that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration.
Now I didn't need to go around  worring{worrying} about it anymore.
After the show had finished, I went to the theatre restaurand{restaurant} to hav{have} something to drink and  relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday.
I think that the best choise{choice} for you is to take the 234 bus.

We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the evants{events} because we could change our plans during the evant{event}.
And I had to controll{control} that nothing was missed.
If we decide to buy somthing{something} special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it.
This way, we would visit the museum as you had planned and n{on} Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished .
Homework is easier to do with the cumputer{computer} than with a book sometimes.
To make matters worse, we have never had the oppurtunity{opportunity} to see Danny Brook because, instead, there was a different actor!
The building is called the Chiang Kei-shek Momerial{Memorial} Hall.
You'll see al{all} the generations who passed through here.
In my point of vue{view}, the Internet is the most important invention of the 2000 centery{century}.
I have chosen them because I am candidat{candidate} to masters in sports in water polo.
In the second place I add that I would prefer an accomodation{accommodation} in a tent, even though it is not very comfortable, because I want to put myself to the test by living in  conditions I am not used to.
Neither the beautiful surranding{surroundings} near your theatre nor the comfortable seats will  recompansate{compensate} for my horrible evening.
First of all I can go to Camp California only in July because I will start working at our local leisure centre as a swimming instructer{instructor} .
When I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not avaible{available}.
Firsty{Firstly}, I would like to thank you warmly for this great prize.
When the musical started at 20:15 (not at 19:30 as advertised) I was really shokked{shocked} when I realised that a different actor was playing his role.
So this evening was terriable{terrible}.
Fathermore{Furthermore}, no discounts were available, even though we had a student card.
I'll never return  because of the bad service you ofer{offer}.
Mabey{Maybe} next time you can come with me.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the beggining{beginning} of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes.
I have chosen golf because I have been playing golf sine{since} 1998 and I want to improve  and then I decided to start a new kind of sport and I would like to start  climbing.
After the show I decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete{cigarette} to try to calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman's day off.
Besides this, in connexion{connection} with the activities we will have the chance to do, I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both, especially at tennis.
It was very interesting and enjoing{enjoying}.
There has been a change in the relatinships{relationships} between people.
Conclugen{Conclusion}: To sum up the above I'd like to suggest not filming anything longer than 1 or 2 minuts{minutes} and having a nice mixture of places, faces and events.
I can sing  plenty of songs, which include  English songs and the japenese{japanese} songs, and I have a part-time job  sining{singing} at a restaurant.
With all the dissatisfuction{dissatisfaction} above, therefore, I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it should have been.
Because we are living  a computerlised{computerised} life,  we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well.

Actually, I read the advertisment{advertisement} for the show and there were a few mistakes in it.

Weapons and  factories are destroying our planet and we need to realise that we have to use tecnology{technology} to impruve{improve} our lives, while always triying{trying} to respect nature.
I hope to give you all the information you need and, please, if you want more information or somenthing{something} is not clear, please don't esitate{hesitate} to contact me again.
If you do that, there will be no bussiness{business} for you and no satisfaction for them.
Now Ted is rejected by everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his honestity{honesty}.
We think that we could go there on the  14th of March, in the eveninng{evening}, instead of going shopping.

From there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, wich{which} both take you very close to the conference centre, and also you can go by underground to get there.
Finally I would like to ask you if I need any money, because you say all accomodation{accommodation} and travel costs are paid for.
Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer{transfer} some equipment.
First of all, when I paid my entrance fee they didn't acept{accept}  my discount ticket, they told me that the ticket was fake, then I entered  the theatre and I had to wait 45 minutes.
